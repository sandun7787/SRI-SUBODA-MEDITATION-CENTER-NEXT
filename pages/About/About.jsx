        The Sri Subodha Retreat Centre was established as the main retreat center of Sri Subodharama International Buddhist Centre, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. The construction of the buildings in the center began in 2007, with the building of a Dhamma hall and two kutis. The development of the center has been made possible by the commitment and support provided by the Most Venerable Wattegama Dhammawasa Nayaka Maha Thero and by many devotees. Venerable Dhammawasa Nayaka Maha Thero, who is the Chief Incumbent and the President of the Centre, is also the Chief Incumbent of the Sri Subodharama International Buddhist Centre, Peradeniya, the Chief Sanganayaka for Sri Lanka, and the Sanganayaka for Australia, Providing guidance and meditation instructions to all who sought it, it was he who pioneered the meditation center. The Chief Nun, Ven. Nadimale Sudhamma, played a major role in building this center. For many years, she conducted retreats and openly provided spiritual support and meditation guidance. Her tireless work and her effort in many ways to keep the center running smoothly, will be remembered forever.
